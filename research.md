### ðŸ“Œ A PINNs-Based MPC Framework for SIR Epidemics  
*Submitted to NeurIPS 2025 as first author*  
A novel control framework using physics-informed neural networks to jointly estimate states and parameters from noisy epidemic data, under minimal prior knowledge.

- Designed basic, log-scaled, and split-integral PINNs tailored to SIR dynamics  
- Achieved up to **92% improvement** in relative error under high-variance noise  
- Implemented ~300 simulations and co-authored the manuscript

### ðŸ“Œ Resilient Distributed MPC for LPV Systems  
*Accepted by Asian Journal of Control (First Author)*  
Proposed a quantized DMPC method resilient to DoS attacks and state delays.

- Developed minâ€“max DMPC under quantized feedback exchange  
- Proved stability via Lyapunov functions and validated via simulation

### ðŸ“Œ Adaptive ET-MPC for LPV Systems  
*Under review at Journal of Process Control (Q1, IFAC, IF â‰ˆ 4.0)*  
Designed a co-optimized ETMPC strategy addressing delays, saturation, and disturbances.

- Jointly optimized control and triggering via Lyapunovâ€“Krasovskii formulation  
- Derived invariant sets for robustness and proved mean-square ISS
